;;
;; Note: Keep in mind only the search request is available without an MBID
;; (or, in specific cases, a disc ID, ISRC or ISWC). If all you have is the
;; name of an artist or album, for example, you'll need to make a search and
;; pick the right result to get its MBID; only then will you able to use it
;; in a lookup or browse request.
;;
;; On the genre resource, we support an "all" sub-resource to fetch all genres,
;; paginated, in alphabetical order:
;;
;;  all:      /genre/all?limit=<LIMIT>&offset=<OFFSET>

;;;; ; ; ; ; ;

;; Browse requests are a direct lookup of all the entities directly linked
;; to another entity ("directly linked" here meaning it does not include
;; entities linked by a relationship). For example, you may want to see all
;; releases on the label ubiktune:

;; /ws/2/release?label=47e718e1-7ee4-460c-b1cc-1192a841c6e5

;; Note that browse requests are not searches: in order to browse all the releases
;; on the ubiktune label you will need to know the MBID of ubiktune.

;; The order of the results depends on what linked entity you are browsing
;; by (however it will always be consistent). If you need to sort the entities,
;; you will have to fetch all entities and sort them yourself.

;; Keep in mind only the search request is available without an MBID (or, in
;; specific cases, a disc ID, ISRC or ISWC). If all you have is the name of an
;; artist or album, for example, you'll need to make a search and pick the right
;; result to get its MBID to use it in a lookup or browse request.
